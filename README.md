# Kubectl Dashboard

A sub-command for `kubectl` that will instantly make a Kubernetes dashboard available for you, without having to run anything in your cluster.

Currently it works if you're using it inside the dashboard image directory.

## Build

Should create a Docker build file that uses the Kubernetes dashboard image to extract the assets.
